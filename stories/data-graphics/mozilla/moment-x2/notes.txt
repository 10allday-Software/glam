- engagement summary – what are we trying to show? For each feature, how much it is being used by f2f vs. other (organic)?
– activity zoom-in: is each activity type different?

========== emily / marissa sync-up

– KPIs:
  - are these the right set?
  - can we clarify what these definitions mean?
  - is a bignum the right approach here vs. a small multiple?

current period vs. previous: week over week
no cumulative numbers here
progress to goal: retention -> move to "% of clients who have migrated"
  - there is a ceiling because not everyone can transition
We might still need cumulative number as well
add % change & baselines below

the comparison should bre wow
success metric isn't implemented yet
we needd a goal that is a counterfactual for fennec retention as if fenix didn't exist
product -> user behavior
marketing -> acquisition metrics
the dashboard will need the ability to flip between channels
channel: fenix channels (not fennec)

churn chart: people who were on fennec who transitioned, people still on fennec, people who actually churned on fennec
The fennec chart might be better as a series of line charts?

retention charts: for nightly, lets provide some confidence intervals or something?
smaller graphs: overall, established, new retention rate

growth metrics: f2f, fennec, fenix


user behavior pages –––––– mock up, get the conversation rolling



========== moment-x meeting

PROGRESS:
– working with ops to get first link deployed. What should the url be? incline.SOMETHING.firefox.com?

– sketching the executive summary section. 

– Focusing on the exec summary will allow a bunch of new components we can easily use for the other sections:
  - churn chart (we will need this more in the future)
  – a generalized line chart that supports 1 time series or multiple ones, with lots of options
  – a BigNumber component that can be used on all three sections

– {demo} this is pretty rough. There aren't annotations, I haven't put much into the design yet, this week
  expect a lot of changes. I'll be posting gifs and updates in the channel as they occur and collect feedback.

QUESTIONS:
– what breakoff meetings do we need this week?
  - ops (melissa) – notified about upcoming deploy, need to file bug and get the ball rolling on the first deploy very quickly.
    will have this bug filed today and have a link to y'all real soon.
  – data (jeff & marissa & emily) – let's sync up about the data plan so I know what to expect
    - jeff and frank will let me know what's going on as soon as possible
  – executive page review – once I have data for the executive page, let's go through and get feedback (emily + marissa + anyone else)

- category_segment and category_segment_group are all "Overall". Is this expected?

- Big Number KPIs – Current period vs. "previous period" – what should "previous period" be here?

– Big Number KPIs – I'm assuming we want to just show single numbers + some percentage diff. Is that enough? I can easily throw up a bunch of small multiples instead.
We haven't really talked about that yet and I want to make sure everyone is happy.

– Big Number KPIs – have these all been agreed on? Should we have a conversation about which is which?
  – if "yes these are the agreed on numbers" 
    – what is "change in fenix"?
    – "progress to goal: retention" – which retention is this?
    – "success metric": 
– Meetings I want to have:
  - data sync-up w/ jeff and marissa (format, naming conventions, etc.)




Order of operations:

– demoware – show the proof of concept of the dashboard components.
– feedback & generalize – incorporate feedback as it comes aggressively, generalize parts so that it is easy to make tweaks
  - graph annotations
  – section annotations
